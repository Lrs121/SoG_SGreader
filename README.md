This is a work in progress tool that reads the savegame from [Secrets of Grindea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/269770/Secrets_of_Grindea/).
Some key features like changing the nickname or equipment already do work, you can edit your equipment style and   
even your inventory contents and skill points. If you are interested how the save game file is build, you can find the structure   
of the save game on the [wiki page](https://github.com/tolik518/SoG_SGreader/wiki/Savegame-File-Structure).

If you want your savegame to work you need to save it over to "%APPDATA%\Secrets of Grindea\Characters" and name it 0.cha to 8.cha
