This is a work in progress tool that reads the savegame from [Secrets of Grindea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/269770/Secrets_of_Grindea/).
Some key features like changing the nickname or equipment already do work, you can edit your equipment style and   
even your inventory contents. If you are interested how the save game file is build, you can find the structure   
of the save game on the [wiki page](https://github.com/tolik518/SoG_SGreader/wiki/Savegame-File-Structure).

If you want your savegame to work you need to save it over to "%APPDATA%\Secrets of Grindea\Characters" and name it 0.cha to 8.cha
  
There is still a lot to do.
e.x
- Reset all variables when a new savegame is loaded
- Split "Sog_Spells"-Enum into the "_Sog_Spells"-Class
- Option to let the user decide if the population of the combobox should be filtered or not
- Do we really need to be able to edit Quickslots?
- If an Item that was equipped is not in the inventory, add to the inventory
- Better visualization of the inventory
- Import/Export as JSON or XML 
- Research: e.x How pets are stored and what other stuff is left in savegame
- Research: why we cant change the equipped weapon, shied and shoes? <- something to do with inventory?
- Documentation of the functionality and of the research process
