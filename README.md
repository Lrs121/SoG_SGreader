# SoG Savegame Reader/Editor ![Icon](https://returnnull.de/images/_64.png)

This is a work in progress tool that reads the savegame from [Secrets of Grindea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/269770/Secrets_of_Grindea/).
Some key features like changing the nickname or equipment already do work and you can edit your equipment style.
There is still a lot to do.
e.x
* Filter the suggested items after by slot
* Add a feature to select colors for clothing etc, we already have an enum for that with the colors
* Inventory editing (we are already reading and storing the items in a list)
* Research: e.x How pets are stored and what outher stuff is left in savegame
* Research: what the first 4 bytes stand for, these are NOT magic bytes
* Research: why we cant change the equiped weapon, shied and shoes? <- somethign to do with inventory
* Documentation of the functionality and of the research process
* And tons of other stuff
